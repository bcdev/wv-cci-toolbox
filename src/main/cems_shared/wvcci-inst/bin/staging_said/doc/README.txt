Hi Olaf,


The mosaic has been divided into 16 parts (4x4)

 h18v04.005.02.txt is for the part number 2 and  h18v04.005.06.txt for the part number 6.

Yes it can be done once if we keep the same resolution and the number of subdivisions;

Yes I have already do this stage but I have done some modifications in the last version, so it will better to redo it again and I will delete the old files.

But if you want to use the old version you can find it here:

/group_workspaces/cems/globalalbedo/match/
